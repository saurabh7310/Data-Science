    "### Q1 - Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The advantages of using fuctions is that, functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update."

    "\n",
    "Ans - The “def” keyword is a statement for defining a function in Python. You start a function with the def keyword, specify a name followed by a colon (:) sign. The “def” call creates the function object and assigns it to the name given. You can further re-assign the same function object to other names."

    "\n",
    "Ans - A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script of fuction when it completes its task. Since everything in Python is an object. So we can use any Python object as a return value."

    "\n",
    "Ans - When it encounters an error the contromis passed to the except block, skipping the code in between. As seen in the above code, we have moved out code inside a tru and excet statement. Try running the program and it should throw and error message instead of crashing the program."

    "\n",
    "Ans - The try block lets you  test a block of code for errors. The except block lets you handle the error. The else block you execute code when there is no error. The finally block lets you execute code, reardles of the result of the try-and except blocks."
